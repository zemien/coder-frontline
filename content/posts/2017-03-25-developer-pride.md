My development manager recently asked us for input on building an engineering culture at work. I semi-coined a new term: developer pride. The term has gotten <a class="external-link" href="http://codesqueeze.com/do-managers-prey-on-developer-pride/" rel="nofollow">bad rep</a> in the past, but I want to reclaim it in the same way the LGBT rights movement transformed the word _pride_ from the negative connotations of being a [deadly sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins#Pride) to the [antidote to shame](http://www.theallusionist.org/allusionist/pride). So what does developer pride mean to me?

Developer pride manifests itself through three beliefs:

  * I recognize the importance of my work because software underpins the backbone of the organisation.
  * I take pride in delivering the best solution I can to realize business value.
  * I appreciate my fellow developers as the best technical resource I have. I succeed when they succeed.

How does developer pride translate into practices?

  * I take time to ensure my work is correct. &#8220;_It compiles on my machine_&#8221; is no longer good enough. 
      * Are there automated tests? (xUnit, Postman, Selenium)
      * Did I manual test it if there are no integration tests?
      * Written in a way that other devs can understand? (following code standards)
      * Is it documented? (descriptive commit message, Confluence entries, useful comments)
  * I put _developer ego_ aside in order to deliver business value. 
      * I recognize that &#8220;good enough&#8221;<sup>1</sup> code is sufficient as long as it doesn't create technical debt. There's no need for an over-architected solution or spending 4 hours reducing a 10-line method down to a one-line statement just so I can demonstrate my <a class="external-link" href="http://codefu.mk/" rel="nofollow">code-fu</a>.
      * Humans make mistakes. Let's get on with fixing the problem instead of trying to find someone to blame.
  * I am happy to have my code reviewed by my peers, and I will happily do the same for them. 
      * Code reviews let me see my code from a different viewpoint. I welcome challenges as it may expose a blind spot.
      * I do code reviews because I want to learn how other developers approach problems. It is not a fault-finding exercise!
      * We review code, not the coder.
  * I devote time for continuous personal growth. 
      * I explore new toolsets and technologies because even the best knives need sharpening.
      * I take the chance to observe how the business runs because it provides a level of visibility that Kanban/Scrum backlog stories do not. This helps me deliver better business value.
  * I communicate with my colleagues with respect<sup>2</sup> because I recognize them as the best in the industry. This is especially pertinent during disagreements, which is common when many smart minds work on the same problem.

1: &#8220;good enough&#8221; will be defined by agreed design patterns and coding standards. We can fit an entire program into a single procedural Main() method which works but is probably not good enough by our standards.

2: A fantastic model for verbal communication can be found in <a class="external-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Second/dp/0071771328/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=" rel="nofollow">Crucial Conversations</a>, which I will blog about soon.

I don't know if the term developer pride will be adopted by the team, but that is how I intend to carry myself. Do you have pride?
