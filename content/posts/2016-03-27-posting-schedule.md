The posting schedule for this blog is about once a week. I set aside about 4 hours a week to work on the blog, and this week I'm using that time to approve a new logo through <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/actualreviewnet/design-3-awesome-and-professional-logo-design-concepts-for-your-business-logo" target="_blank">Mike on Fiverr</a>Â and update some site elements based on the new graphics.

My posts on culture resume next week.
