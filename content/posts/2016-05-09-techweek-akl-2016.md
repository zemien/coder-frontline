The first ever [Techweek AKL](http://techweek.co.nz/) starts in less than a week and I'm excited to attend some of the events. I think it's a great start to building NZ's tech resources. Sure, it's no TechCrunch Disrupt but this will definitely start us down that path. However I don't think it's very well publicised as I only found out about it while glancing through the last [Our Auckland newsletter](http://ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/). Consider this my small part in raising its visibility.

Techweek AKL has various events that help you &#8220;immerse yourself in the latest STEM trends from nanotech to biotech, from the Internet of Things to virtual reality, from the on-demand economy to peer-to-peer business.&#8221; While it's not a programming-centric event, software will undoubtedly be a major driving force behind those new breakthroughs. Hence I think it's helpful for software developers to check out some of the events and network with current/future industry leaders.

Unfortunately there is a cost involved in many of the main keynote events as they involve international speakers. I am a bit cash-strapped at the moment so have focused my attendance on the free events. Come say hi if you see me at the following Techweek AKL events:

  * 16 May (Monday) 5-8pm: [The Connected City with Nokia and JLL](http://techweek.co.nz/events/the-connected-city-with-nokia-and-jll#content)
  * 17 May (Tuesday) 6-9pm: [Functional Reactive Programming in Java with Sodium](http://www.meetup.com/Functional-Programming-Auckland/events/229451761/)

There are many others I would like to check out but they happen during working hours or have a decent cost involved. I highly recommend checking out the [Ethereum - Disrupting the Global Financial System](http://techweek.co.nz/events/ethereum-disrupting-the-global-financial-system#content) mini-conference ([$280!](http://www.ethereum.nz/)).
