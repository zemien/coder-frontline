      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like doing charitable work. I feel that most of us live privileged lives, whether through circumstance or hard work. Itâ€™s always made sense to me that we have a moral imperative to help those who are less fortunate. I finally found a non-profit where I can apply my IT experience to help charitable organisations do just that and positively impact the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On-boarding programmes, also known as induction programmes, are the set of activities designed to get a new hire up and running in the organisation as soon as possible. I discussed a few types of &lt;a href=&#34;/induction-programmes-new-hires/&#34;&gt;induction programmes&lt;/a&gt; last week. I will share my own experiences with on-boarding below, including the elements that go into making an effective plan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Few tech companies give much thought to formal induction programmes for new employees. It does not seem to give much benefit at first glance, since it happens irregularly. I have experienced both well-structured and informal induction programmes, and I can wholeheartedly say I prefer the former.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
